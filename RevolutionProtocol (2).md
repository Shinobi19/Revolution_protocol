#### Vulnerability details

##### Impact
The `AuctionHouse::settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction` function is used to first settle the current auction and create a new one and can be called by anyone. Lets take a look at `_settleAuction()`. Here we send the highest bidder the `VerbToken`, pay the creators(ETH and ERC20) and pay the owner. The max amount of creators an art can have is `100`. If malicious user adds art with 100 creators(smart contracts with unbounded loops) that will consume all the gas when receiving ETH and his art wins, the following check in `_createAuction`: `require(gasleft() >= MIN_TOKEN_MINT_GAS_THRESHOLD, "Insufficient gas for creating auction");
` might fail. If somehow this doesn't fail, the user that called `settleCurrentAndCreateNewAuction` will end up paying a lot of gas, which may lead to less trust in the contract.

##### Tools Used
Manual Review

##### Recommended Mitigation Steps
Use `pull over push` method when sending the rewards to the creators(ETH and ERC20).


##### Assessed type

DoS
